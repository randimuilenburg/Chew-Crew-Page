      <h1>The Chew Crew</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Chew Crew! Our mission is to provide your pup with safe,
        engaging, and affordable chew toys. You never have to worry about a
        chewed shoe or a broken tooth again.
      </p>
      <p>
        All our chews are made with flavored and scented durable rubber in three
        different toughness levels: puppies, adults, and seniors. We carry six
        flavors: beef, chicken, peanut butter, chocolate (made with carob, which
        is dog-safe!), cheese, and bacon. All toughness levels and flavors come
        in six shapes to keep your pup entertained: stick, steak, carrot, corn
        cob, sock, and frisbee.
